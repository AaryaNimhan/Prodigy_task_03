# 📊 Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their **demographic and behavioral data**.  

The model is trained on the **Bank Marketing Dataset**, which contains customer information and marketing campaign details.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that helps businesses identify potential customers who are likely to purchase a product or service.
